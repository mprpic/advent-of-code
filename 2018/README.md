## General Notes

* All solutions require Python 3.7+.

* All inputs are specified in the `input.txt` file in each day's directory. The solution expects
  that file to be available in the current directory.

* I tried to solve both parts of a single day's puzzle with one algorithm. This made the code a
  bit more cumbersome in few places but added a nice bit of complexity to try to be as efficient
  as possible to achieve two results in e.g. a single loop over a collection.
